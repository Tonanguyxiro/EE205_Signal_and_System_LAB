## Introduction

Here is the lab session of course Signal and System (EE205) in Southern University of Science and Technology (Shenzhen)

## Lab 1: MATLAB Programming

**LAB1 should be submitted before 4th March**

## Lab 2: Linear Time-Invariant Systems

## Lab 3: Fourier Series Representation of Periodic Signals

## Lab 4: The Continuous-Time Fourier Transform

## Lab 5: System, Transform, Convolution and Filter

And also there will we two projects to help studets apply all the technocs learned. The two projects will be held in another respositories

- Project 1. Speech synthesis and perception with envelope cue

- Project 2: OFDM Technology
