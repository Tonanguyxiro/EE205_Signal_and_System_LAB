# EE205 Signal and System LAB

## IMPORTANT

**The files in this project should follow the following instructions.**

### The name of the file

1. We will create a `LABx` folder for each LAB Session.
2. Files need to be named as `Problem_subquestion_others.m`, like `P1_5_a1.m`, except the name of functions, and set the name of the photos with `filename_photoname_out/photoindex.png` like `P_1_5_a1_out1.png`

### The part contained in the code

1. **The code implementation**
2. **Plot**: We need to add all the setings to the plot in the code so that we do not need to adjust the polt if we replot it.
3. **Save** the plots by function `saveas(gcf, "LAB1/P1_4_f_out2.png");`, here we are running the program in root dictionary.

### About the lab report

#### Format

1. The introduction section should include what you will do in this LAB
2. You can copy from the introduction of the problem
3. Argument and Analysis should be included in the LAB report
4. All MATLAB codes should be included at the end of the file.

#### Content


## Introduction

Here is the lab session of course Signal and System (EE205) in Southern University of Science and Technology (Shenzhen)


### Team members

- YUAN Tong (Student ID: 11810818)
- DAI Yujin (Student ID: 11910114)

## Lab 1: MATLAB Programming

**NOTICE: LAB1 should be submitted before 11th March**

In lab 1

#### Proofing of  linear system

We use $\delta [n]$ as the test input, 

## Lab 2: Linear Time-Invariant Systems

## Lab 3: Fourier Series Representation of Periodic Signals

## Lab 4: The Continuous-Time Fourier Transform

## Lab 5: System, Transform, Convolution and Filter

And also there will we two projects to help studets apply all the technocs learned. The two projects will be held in another respositories

- Project 1. Speech synthesis and perception with envelope cue
- Project 2: OFDM Technology
