# EE205 Signal and System LAB

## IMPORTANT

**The files in this project should follow the following instructions.**

### The name of the file
1. We will create a `LABx` folder for each LAB Session. 
2. Files need to be named as `Problem_subquestion_others.m`, like `P1_5_a1.m`, except the name of functions, and set the name of the photos with `filename_photoname_out/photoindex.png` like `P_1_5_a1_out1.png`

### The part contained in the code
1. **The code implementation**
2. **Plot**: We need to add all the setings to the plot in the code so that we do not need to adjust the polt if we replot it.
3. **Save** the plots by function `saveas(gcf, "LAB1/P1_4_f_out2.png");`, here we are running the program in root dictionary.

### About the lab report
To be completed.


## Introduction

Here is the lab session of course Signal and System (EE205) in Southern University of Science and Technology (Shenzhen)

## Lab 1: MATLAB Programming

**LAB1 should be submitted before 4th March**

In lab 1

## Lab 2: Linear Time-Invariant Systems

## Lab 3: Fourier Series Representation of Periodic Signals

## Lab 4: The Continuous-Time Fourier Transform

## Lab 5: System, Transform, Convolution and Filter

And also there will we two projects to help studets apply all the technocs learned. The two projects will be held in another respositories

- Project 1. Speech synthesis and perception with envelope cue

- Project 2: OFDM Technology
